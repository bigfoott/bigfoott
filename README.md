### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anthony, a senior Computer Science undergrad from New Jersey with a strong interest in virtual reality.

- I'm currently focused on the [VR Speedrunning Leaderboards], a project that makes it easy to view different VR games' leaderboards.
- Check out the various projects related to VRSR [here].
