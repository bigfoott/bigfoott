### Hello! 👋

#### I'm Anthony, software dev from New Jersey with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and an interest in web development and virtual reality.

#

I'm currently focused on a few projects!

* [VR Speedrunning Leaderboards] is a project that makes it easy to view different VR games' leaderboards. Check out the various projects related to VRSR [here].
* [ScrapedDuck] is a project that routinely scrapes [LeekDuck.com] and pushes the found data to a branch on the repository, to be used by other external applications.
* [MMM-PokemonGOEvents] is a project that displays Pokémon GO events on a [MagicMirror²].
