## Hello! 👋

### I'm Anthony, a senior Computer Science undergrad from New Jersey.

Other than school, I'm currently focused on the [VR Speedrunning Leaderboards], a project that makes it easy to view different VR games' leaderboards. Check out the various projects related to VRSR [here].

View my [programming portfolio] or check out some of the [3D printed art] I've made (which is also available on [Thingiverse])!
